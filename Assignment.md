## Description

Use the Foursquare API to build an app that shows a list of venues around the user's location. Optionally, give the user the possibility to adjust the radius of interest. Decide which venue details should be relevant to the user. You have complete freedom on how to present data on screen. 

We have set up the project structure for you to kickstart the development process. 

There are two targets available: one for SwiftUI and the other for UIKit. 

You can choose whichever technology you're most comfortable with for the implementation. To streamline the development process and ensure consistency with our existing projects, we kindly request you to use the [AdyenNetworking]([https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-networking-ios](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-networking-ios)) library for performing network requests. Submit the code that you consider to be final. 

We'll check your implementation to understand mobile platform specifics, correct UX choices, overall architecture design, and code quality.
